## 👩‍💻 About Me

Hello there! I’m **Mary Majala**, a curious and creative front-end developer in training through the **ALX Africa Program**.

My journey into software engineering was sparked by a simple fascination: how beautifully designed websites come to life. I’ve always been drawn to visuals—the kind that not only look good but communicate clearly and solve real problems. That’s what inspired me to dive into front-end development.

I’m not just learning to code—I’m learning to create purposefully. My goal is to build websites that are clean, responsive, and meaningful. Whether it’s helping small businesses shine online or crafting tools that make everyday tasks easier, I want my work to have real impact.

Before this, I worked as an **executive virtual assistant**, where I managed digital workflows, organized systems, and solved problems behind the scenes. That experience taught me how to prioritize, stay organized, and pay attention to the tiny details that make a big difference—skills I now bring into my developer toolkit.

Right now, I’m focused on mastering **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**—and bringing my ideas to life through projects that matter. When I’m not coding, I’m probably sketching a layout, researching design patterns, or reflecting on how to grow intentionally in this tech journey.

> I believe in showing up fully, learning relentlessly, and building with heart. 💛
